<u>**Terms of Use**</u>

Last Updated: October 9, 2025

1. **Introduction**

These Terms of Use provide the terms and conditions under which you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity (“you” or “your”), are permitted to use, interact with or otherwise access the website at www.bam.dev (the “Site”) and attendant tools or services (together with the Site, the “Services”) for the Block Assembly Marketplace (“BAM”), including those available at the GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/jito-labs/bam-client).  These Terms of Use, together with any documents and additional terms or policies that are appended hereto or that expressly incorporate these Terms of Use by reference as well as our Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Terms”), constitute a binding agreement between you and Jito Labs, Inc. (“Jito”, “we,” “us,” or “our”).  As referenced in these terms, “user” means someone who views, accesses or otherwise interacts with the Services.

By accessing any Services, you agree to these Terms as governing your use of the Services. These Terms apply to use of the Services, regardless of where or how they are accessed (including outside of or other than via the Site), and regardless of which device is used for access.

<u>NOTICE</u>: PLEASE REVIEW THE TERMS CAREFULLY.  BY ACCESSING, INTERACTING WITH OR USING ANY OF THE SERVICES, YOU AGREE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO ENTER INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT AND, AS SUCH, HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS, INCLUDING THE BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER BELOW (SEE SECTION 8).  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO INTERACT WITH, ACCESS OR USE ANY OF THE SERVICES.

2. **The Services & Third Party Technology**

   a. <u>The Services</u>

The Site provides information about BAM, a network that allows for block building on the Solana blockchain network (“Solana”).  Your use, review or access of the Site does not authorize you to become a BAM Node Operator (as defined below), but does allow you to request to participate in BAM, as a node operator.   

The BAM validator client (available [here](https://github.com/jito-labs/bam-client)) (‘BAM Client”) is open source code that allows validator nodes to connect to BAM, if they so choose.  Your viewing, downloading, accessing or otherwise using the BAM Client is subject to these Terms, but also to the terms of use available on GitHub.  You acknowledge and agree that you are aware that 

As set out further below, nothing on this Site or with regards to the Services guarantees the safety, security, inclusion, or landing of any transaction on Solana via BAM.  BAM does not guarantee the elimination of negative implications of ordering of transactions by third parties, but it may reduce the implications of such conduct by third parties. 

The features of BAM apply only to its component parts and not to any other software that we developed, hosted or currently host, and not to any software that may work within or alongside BAM by third parties.

BAM includes BAM Node Operators (*i.e.*, the hardware layer running encrypted or trusted execution environments), the transaction execution layer of BAM Validators, and the software layer of Plugins that can be built in. 

The BAM Client does not give us access to your validator or node and you agree and acknowledge that we cannot control, provide guarantees for, or access your independent validator or node via the BAM Client or otherwise.  

We may be a BAM Node Operator at any time or at certain points in time, and independent third parties may also be BAM Node Operators at certain points in time.  We are not liable for the actions, activities or communications of any third party and/or independent BAM Node Operator and you expressly disclaim any liability against us and agree to indemnify us for actions arising out of the work of any third party BAM Node Operator. 

If you build a Plugin to work within BAM, there will be separate terms that apply to your work or use of BAM in that capacity, some of which may be available on GitHub.

For the avoidance of doubt, these Terms apply only to this Site and the forms submitted through it. Any information submitted to us via forms on the Site is subject to the Privacy Policy.

b. <u>Third Party Technology</u>

*Solana.*  As noted above, BAM is technology that allows for transparent, efficient, private and verifiable block building on Solana.  Solana is an open, decentralized and permissionless blockchain.  We do not have any control, management or administrative capabilities over Solana and are not responsible for your transactions thereon.  For the avoidance of doubt, Solana is not part of the Site or the Services made available by us under these Terms or otherwise.  We have no ability to monitor or control any use of Solana by you or any third party and expressly disclaim any liability for losses or damages arising from or relating to interaction with, or actions taken on, Solana through BAM or otherwise.  We make no representations or warranties about Solana’s functionality, and expressly disclaim any liability relating to any malfunction or failure of the network. 

*Your Wallet.* You may interact with Solana and third party applications thereon via your self-custodial, self-hosted wallet (“Wallet”).  You acknowledge and agree that we cannot control, provide guarantees for, or access your Wallet or its private keys and that you are solely responsible for your Wallet security.  You should consult the terms of service provided by your Wallet provider to understand your rights and responsibilities as they relate to your Wallet.   This also means that we are unable to assist with transactions: please be vigilant in interacting with Solana or any other immutable blockchain technology.

*Your Cryptoassets.*  Your transactions on Solana or applications thereon necessarily will involve cryptoassets that you hold in your Wallet or otherwise are in possession, custody or control of.  Nothing in BAM allows us, at any time, to take custody of your cryptoassets or otherwise interfere with any transaction or bundle you send to the BAM Network.  You are solely responsible for transactions involving your own cryptoassets and we expressly disclaim any liability for any losses, impairments or other changes – in value or otherwise – with your cryptoassets.

3. **Modifications**

We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify the Terms at any time or from time to time.  The modified Terms will be posted on the Site, and will provide the last updated date at the top of the Terms. Any modified Terms will become effective upon posting.  By continuing to access, use or otherwise interact with any Services after the effective date of any modification to the Terms, you are providing your explicit agreement to be bound by the Terms as modified.  If you do not agree to be bound by any updated Terms, you are prohibited from using, accessing, or otherwise interacting with the Services. It is your responsibility to check the Site you use regularly for modifications to the Terms.

We also reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify the Services at any time and from time to time, with or without notice to you.  We may also eliminate any Service in full or in part, at our sole discretion, with or without notice, including deleting or otherwise materially modifying information.

4. **Your Responsibilities and Representations**

If at any point the above is no longer true, then you must immediately cease using the Services.

*Wallet Configuration.*  You represent and warrant that you – and only you – are responsible for properly configuring, as applicable, and using the Services and for taking appropriate action to secure your data, including without limitation, financial or token information and private keys.  With respect to your Wallet (which is provided by a third party), you are solely responsible for familiarizing yourself with it and its safety and security features, including any private keys and passwords associated therewith.  We will not and cannot access your private key, password, or any cryptoassets held within your Wallet nor can it reverse any transactions you initiate with your Wallet (or otherwise). We cannot be responsible or liable in any way for how you use your Wallet.  
*Sophistication for the Services.* You acknowledge that you (A) are responsible for properly configuring and using the Services and for taking appropriate action to secure your data or the data of any third party for which you’re responsible when doing so, (B) have the technical and financial know-how, experience and sophistication to properly use, access and interact with the Services, (C) understand the inherent risks of blockchain technology, cryptoassets/tokens and smart contracts, among other related technologies, and (D) are facile, adept and able to use and configure the sophisticated hardware and software required for use, access and interaction with the Services.

*Sophistication Regarding Blockchain Technology.*  You further acknowledge that (I) blockchains and their attendant technologies involved in using any Services are novel, technologically complex, and involve inherent risk, (II) protocol upgrades and other technological mechanisms may contain bugs or security vulnerabilities that may result in loss of functionality and ultimately of funds, and (III) the Services involve technological innovations such that the results of usage of or interaction with them depend on factors beyond our control, including but not limited to network health, congestion, latency, incentives, user configuration settings, operation of third party software or hardware, wallet or account compatibility, protocol upgrades or forks, the activities of searchers, block builders and others.  You should also familiarize yourself with the risks associated with transacting on blockchain networks, including but not limited to smart contract vulnerabilities, front end vulnerabilities, hacks, phishing attacks, social engineering attacks, cryptoasset volatility and transaction irreversibility.  You understand that like any other software, the App, the Bot, and the Services could be at risk of third-party malware, hacks or cybersecurity breaches. You agree that it is your responsibility to monitor your assets and Wallet regularly and confirm their proper use and deployment consistent with your intentions. Ostium does not and cannot guarantee the security, performance, or reliability of the Protocol, or any associated blockchain networks, protocols or tools.  As part of your knowledge relating to the use of blockchain technology, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any fees relating to transactions on any blockchain as it relates to the Protocol, including any transaction (or “gas”) fees relating to any blockchain.

*Applicable Law.*  Your access to the Services is not (i) prohibited by and does not otherwise violate or assist you to violate any domestic or foreign law, rule, statute, regulation, by-law, order, protocol, code, decree, or another directive, requirement, or guideline, published or in force that applies to or is otherwise intended to govern or regulate any person, property, transaction, activity, event or other matter, including any rule, order, judgment, directive or other requirement or guideline issued by any domestic or foreign federal, provincial or state, municipal, local or other governmental, regulatory, judicial or administrative authority having jurisdiction over us, you, the Services, or as otherwise duly enacted, enforceable by law, the common law or equity (collectively, “Applicable Laws”); or (ii) contribute to or facilitate any illegal activity.  You represent and warrant that you will comply with all Applicable Laws, and you will not use the Services if the laws of your country, or any Applicable Law, prohibit you from doing so.  ​​

*Financial Risks.*  Use of the Services may carry financial risk. You acknowledge and understand that blockchains and the applications built thereon are inherently risky and highly experimental by their nature and could result in the loss of the full amount supplied. Transactions entered into in connection with Solana are irreversible and final. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in transacting in cryptoassets can be substantial.

9. **Governing Law, Dispute Resolution & Class Action Waiver**

a. <u>Governing Law</u>

These Terms, and your use of the Services, are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to conflict of laws rules. The exclusive jurisdiction for all Claims, to the extent applicable given the mandatory arbitration provisions in the Terms, will be the courts located in the state of Delaware, and you acknowledge and agree that any Claims are subject to the jurisdiction of such courts, and waive any objection to the laying of such venue.

b. <u>Dispute Resolution</u>

Prior to commencing any legal proceeding of any kind against us, including an arbitration, you and we agree that we will attempt to resolve any Claim by engaging in good faith negotiations.  Such negotiation requires that the aggrieved party provide written notice to the other party specifying the nature and details of the dispute (the “Initial Notice”). The party receiving such notice shall have 20 days to respond, and within 45 days after the Initial Notice was sent, the parties shall meet and confer in good faith to try and resolve the Claim. If the parties are unable to do so within 90 days of the Initial Notice, the parties may agree to mediate their dispute or either party may submit to arbitration according to these Terms.

c. <u>Mandatory Arbitration</u>

Any Claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity of the Terms, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be determined by arbitration in Delaware before a single arbitrator.  This Section will not preclude parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction.

Any arbitration will be conducted by JAMS pursuant to its rules then in effect, except as modified by these Terms. Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules. All other claims shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (collectively, the “JAMS Rules”). 

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THE TERMS, THE PARTIES ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR CLASS ARBITRATION.

d. <u>Class Action Waiver</u>

Any arbitration under the Terms shall take place on an individual basis – class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that any proceedings to resolve any Claim will be brought and conducted only in your individual capacity and not as a party (plaintiff or otherwise) or member of any class (or purported class), consolidated proceeding, multi-plaintiff proceeding or representative action or proceeding.

Any arbitration will not be permitted to be consolidated or aggregated with any other arbitration and the arbitrator will not have any authority to do so, and will not have the authority to make an award to any person or entity not a part of the individual arbitration in which you are a party. You further agree that any arbitrator may not preside over any form of class action involving you and us.

10. **General Provisions**

a. <u>No Relationship</u>

Nothing in the Terms shall be construed to create any relationship between you and us other than as defined herein.  Neither you nor we are an agent of each other under these Terms or otherwise, and you shall have no right to hold yourself out as in any way having a relationship with us other than as someone using, accessing or otherwise interfacing with the Services.

b. <u>Assignments</u>

You agree you are not permitted to assign or otherwise transfer any of your rights and obligations under the Terms, but Jito may assign or transfer the Terms, in whole or in part, without restriction.  Any assignment or transfer by you in violation of this Section will be void. Subject to the foregoing, the Terms will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

c. <u>Entire Agreement</u>

The Terms, including any policies that expressly or impliedly incorporate the Terms by reference, constitute the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter herein.  The Terms supersede all prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings, agreements, or communications between you and us, if any, whether written or verbal, regarding the subject matter of the Terms.

d. <u>No Waiver</u>

The failure by us to enforce any provision of the Terms will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit our right to enforce such provision at a later time. All waivers by us must be in writing to be effective.

e. <u>Severability</u>

If any portion of the Terms are held to be unenforceable or invalid, the remainder of the Terms will continue in full force and effect. Any invalid or unenforceable portions will be interpreted to effectuate the intent of the original portion. If such construction is not possible, the invalid or unenforceable portion will be severed from the Terms, but the rest of the Terms will remain in full force and effect.

f. <u>Notice</u>

Any notices or other communications provided by us under these Terms will be given: (i) via email; or (ii) by posting to the Services. For notices made by email, the date of receipt will be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.
